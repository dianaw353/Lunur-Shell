### Option 3: Manual Installation

#### Step 1: Install Dependencies - Arch Linux

Run the following command to install the required system packages:
```
  cat assets/packages/arch/packages_aur.txt assets/packages/arch/packages_official.txt assets/packages/arch/packages_python.txt | yay -S --needed -
  sudo pacman -U https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/p/python-gobject/python-gobject-3.50.0-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst 
```
> [!NOTE]
> It's required to add `python-gobject` package to the `IgnorePkg` variable on `/etc/pacman.conf`. Failure to do so will crash the shell upon upgrading the said package until the downgrade is performed again.
